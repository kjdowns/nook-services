# Nook Services

Nook Services is a JS React/Redux web application meant as a companion for the Nintendo Switch game Animal Crossing New Horizons. The application hosts a list of informational pages about different collectible items and game mechanics. Pages include collection trackers for both Bugs and Fish, as well as informational pages about Mystery Islands, Flower breeding, and the Stalk Market. Signing up in the application allows the user to persist collectible tracking data.
